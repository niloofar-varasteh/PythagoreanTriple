# PythagoreanTriple

Pythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem . This theorem applies to right-angled triangles, stating that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
Characteristics of Pythagorean triples include:
Integers: All three numbers in the triple are whole numbers. They cannot be fractions or decimals.
Right-Angled Triangle: The triple represents the side lengths of a right-angled triangle.
Commutative Property: The values of a and b can be interchanged without affecting their status as a Pythagorean triple. That is, if (a,b,c) is a Pythagorean triple, then (b,a,c) is also a Pythagorean triple.
Primitive and Non-Primitive Triples: A Pythagorean triple is called primitive if a,b, and c are coprime (they have no common divisor other than 1). For example, (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple. Non-primitive triples are multiples of primitive triples, like (6, 8, 10) which is 2 times the primitive triple (3, 4, 5).
Identify a formula for the systematic generation of Pythagorean triples.
